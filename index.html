             <p>A screen buffer is a two-dimensional array of character and color data for output in a console window. A console can have multiple screen buffers. The active screen buffer is the one that is displayed on the screen. The system creates a screen buffer whenever it creates a new console. Click the "Console" tab in that window. You should use the console. log() method to print to console JavaScript. The JavaScript console log function is mainly used for code debugging as it makes the JavaScript print the output to the console</p>
